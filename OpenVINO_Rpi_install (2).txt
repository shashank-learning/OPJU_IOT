

1.	Go to Downloads folder
cd Downloads

2.	Install the OpenVINO (2020.4) toolkit using wget command
wget --no-check-certificate https://storage.openvinotoolkit.org/repositories/openvino/packages/2020.4/l_openvino_toolkit_runtime_raspbian_p_2020.4.287.tgz

By default, the package file is saved as l_openvino_toolkit_runtime_raspbian_p_<version>.tgz.

Note: If the file isn’t run by wget, use go to this link and download from GUI
Link : https://storage.openvinotoolkit.org/repositories/openvino/packages/2020.4/ 

3.	Create an installation folder.

sudo mkdir -p /opt/intel/openvino_2021

4.	Unpack the archive:

sudo tar -xf  l_openvino_toolkit_runtime_raspbian_p_2020.4.287.tgz --strip 1 -C /opt/intel/openvino_2021


5.	Set the Environment Variables
You must update several environment variables before you can compile and run OpenVINO toolkit applications. Run the following script to temporarily set the environment variables:
source /opt/intel/openvino_2021/bin/setupvars.sh

**(Optional)** The OpenVINO environment variables are removed when you close the shell. As an option, you can permanently set the environment variables as follows:
Ssh 

6.	Add USB Rules for an Intel® Neural Compute Stick 2 device
This task applies only if you have an Intel® Neural Compute Stick 2 device.
Add the current Linux user to the users group:

sudo usermod -a -G users "$(whoami)"

To perform inference on the Intel® Neural Compute Stick 2, install the USB rules running the install_NCS_udev_rules.sh script:

sh /opt/intel/openvino_2021/install_dependencies/install_NCS_udev_rules.sh


7.	Log out and log in for it to take effect. (Reboot )

sudo reboot

To test your change, open a new terminal. You will see the following:

[setupvars.sh] OpenVINO environment initialized

8.	Plug in your Intel® Neural Compute Stick 2 in USB 2.0

9.	Checking for Movidius Device (VPU)

dmesg | grep Movidius

You will get the following output indicating that we have Movidius MyriadX connected to Raspberry Pi
